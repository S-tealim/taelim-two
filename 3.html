<p style="margin-top:80px;">“Having the opportunity to carry forward a 70-year tradition and follow
in the footsteps of outstanding chairs such
as Otto Wolff von Amerongen and Klaus Mangold is both a duty
and an incentive”, said Hermes
on being appointed. “The OAOEV is the German economy’
most important bridge to 29 countries in Central and Eastern Europe. My company,
Wilo, has hugely benefited from these networks
– which are the envy of many in Europe.”</p>
